This year, KubeCon will be held in Chicago from November 6-10.

[Odigos, an open-source project](https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos) for effortless distributed tracing in all applications without code changes, will be there, and we'd love to see you!

At KubeCon, we'll be showcasing our latest updates, including:

- Version 1.0 of Odigos open-source
- Odigos Cloud Beta
- Discuss eBPF-based auto-instrumentation and its huge performance benefits

**We look forward to seeing you there!**
